# Data Science Specialization Course Projects Repo

- Any questions or requests can be fielded to Erhard Menker at ejmenker@gmail.com
- This folder is created to house a repository that includes all of the JHU data science specialization course projects (except for the capstone) so that they can be pushed to Github in 1 shared repository
- Each course project(s) exists at the main level of a folder named after the course; all these course folders are at this repo's main level
- Supplemental notes can be found in the main level data science specialization folder in the ErhardMenker MOOCNotes repository on Github 
- This repository is meant to track & present the programs, original input files that must exist are available upon request with project explanations a matter of public record at the respective course at: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science
- This specialization is my first formal introduction to data science; the evolution should be evident as original projects are not reproducible with fundamental flaws (dirty scripting, absolute file paths, etc); useful packages are not used in early courses so I could learn how to write base R myself
- For the best evidence of my work in this specialization, please examine my work on the spec's capstone at this repo: https://github.com/ErhardMenker/dataScienceSpecCapstone
