Developing Data Products Course Project Documentation
===========================================================

- After a fair amount of research, **I still have no idea what it means for the documentation to be "on the Shiny website itself."** Any feedback would be great on that; I have posted my app's URL at multiple spots in this document.

**A. Overview**

- This project shows an application of Shiny to develop an interactive data science product.
- My Shiny app is an interactive tool that allows users to eyeball a data set and then fit what they believe to be the best linear relationship.
- The app sources the commonly used mtcars built in data set.
- The user's determined best fit can then be compared to the actual linear fit gathered by used the normal equation which minimizes least squares.
- For fun, the user can randomly "shock" the data; the app adds random normals to both coordinates. User & least squares lines can be fit to this new data to highlight how susceptible the best linear fit is to random shocks


**B. Working the App**

- Again, the app can be deployed at: 
- https://erhardmenker.shinyapps.io/courseProject/

1) Look at the original mtcars dataset plotted; first continue to alter the **"y-intercept"** & **"slope"** sliders to fit the linear line that you believe best fits the data set.
2) Once you have selected this optimal pair of parameters, check off the **"Show Your Line?"** box; feel free to continue to alter the parameters by use of the sliders at any point in time.
3) Check to see how your line compares to the line chosen algorithmically by the least squares fit by checking off **"Show Least Squares Line?"**
4) Uncheck both of the previous boxes and then shock the values by checking the **"Shock Values?"** box
5) Repeat the previous steps of reasoning out which line you think is best and comparing to the line chosen by least squares

**C. What's the Point?**

- Data scientists often estimate least squares and take the resulting fit at face value.
- This app could be useful for really important data sets; it gives the user the opportunity to think about what the linear relationship would look like pre-estimation and then compare why expectations did not exactly match reality (outliers? polynomial terms needed?).
- The concept of a random shocker indicates how susceptible the line fit is to stochastic variations in the data, and gives a sense for goodness-of-fit that is more intuitive than most statistical tests (especially for a non-technical audience).
