This markdown explains the two dataframes created by ./run_analysis.r
This document relies on and sources the zip file that can be downloaded at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The data are described from the original source at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The dataset includes the following files at ./data/UCI HAR Dataset:
===================================================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The dataset includes the following files at ./ :
================================================

- "CodeBook.md'

- 'README.md'

- 'run_analysis.r'

The data that are calculated include the series:
================================================

- Note that units are described at the original source whose URL is posted at this CodeBook's overview

Unit Notes:
===========

- Series postscripted with "XYZ" is the 3 axial signal in the X, Y, and Z direction

- Series postscripted with "Mag" is the Euclidean Norm calculated in 3 dimensional space. 

- Concepts (3 Axial Signals calculated via Fast Fourier Transform) in DF_ALL:

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

Reported Methods of Measurement (Normalized to be bounded on [-1, 1]):

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

Further Transformations Occur and Appear in DF_SMRY:

mean: the mean value of each series in the original units, grouped by activity
standard deviation: the standard deviation of each series in the original units, grouped by activity

Activities:

laying
sitting
standing 
walking
walking downstairs
walking upstairs

Transformations:
================

- Please see ./README.md to see how the original data series were transformed to report the above measures and groupings
