# Statistical Inference Course Project

- This pipeline contains 2 unrelated RMD files meant to communicate basic statistical concepts with applied data:
- ./part1_simulation.R simulates exponential random variables & examines their properties using concepts like the central limit theorem & bootstrapping
- ./part2_analysis.R examines the built-in "ToothGrowth" data frame & executes descriptive statistics & hypothesis testing on the data
